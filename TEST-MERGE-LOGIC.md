# Test Guide: Improved Merge Logic

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

The merge logic now properly handles **deep content changes** like:
- ✅ Region names
- ✅ Day notes  
- ✅ Drive times and distances
- ✅ Accommodation details
- ✅ Place descriptions
- ✅ All text fields

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Region Name Changes
1. **Device A**: Change region of Day 1 from "Barcelona" to "Barcelona City Center"
2. **Device A**: Sync to Google Drive
3. **Device B**: Click "Sync Now"
4. **Expected**: Device B should show "Barcelona City Center"

### Test 2: Day Notes Changes
1. **Device A**: Add notes to Day 2: "Remember to visit the cathedral"
2. **Device A**: Sync to Google Drive
3. **Device B**: Click "Sync Now"
4. **Expected**: Device B should show the notes

### Test 3: Drive Time/Distance Changes
1. **Device A**: Update drive time from 2 hours to 3 hours
2. **Device A**: Sync to Google Drive
3. **Device B**: Click "Sync Now"
4. **Expected**: Device B should show 3 hours

### Test 4: Accommodation Details
1. **Device A**: Change accommodation name or description
2. **Device A**: Sync to Google Drive
3. **Device B**: Click "Sync Now"
4. **Expected**: Device B should show updated accommodation

### Test 5: Conflict Resolution
1. **Device A**: Change region to "Madrid North"
2. **Device B**: Change same region to "Madrid South" (before syncing)
3. **Device A**: Sync first
4. **Device B**: Sync now
5. **Expected**: Device B keeps "Madrid South" (local wins conflicts)

## 🔍 Debug Information

The console will now show detailed merge information:
```
🔄 Deep merging local and remote changes
🔄 Field conflict for day1.region: local="Madrid South" vs remote="Madrid North", using local
✅ Deep merge completed: {tripName: "...", dayCount: 5, firstDayRegion: "Madrid South"}
```

## 📊 Key Improvements

### Before (Old Logic):
- Only compared number of days
- Ignored content changes within days
- Text changes were lost during sync
- No field-level merging

### After (New Logic):
- Compares every field individually
- Handles empty vs non-empty values
- Merges arrays by combining unique items
- Preserves all content changes
- Detailed logging for debugging

## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Open two browser tabs** (or devices)
2. **Connect both to Google Drive**
3. **Make different changes** on each tab
4. **Sync on tab 1** first
5. **Sync on tab 2** second
6. **Check console logs** for merge details
7. **Verify both changes are preserved**

## 🔧 Smart Merge Rules

1. **Empty → Content**: If local is empty and remote has content, use remote
2. **Content → Empty**: If remote is empty and local has content, use local
3. **Content → Content**: If both have content, prefer local (current session)
4. **Arrays**: Merge by combining unique items
5. **Objects**: Merge field by field recursively

## 📝 Expected Console Output

```
🔄 Deep merging local and remote changes
🔄 Field conflict for day1.region: local="New Value" vs remote="Old Value", using local
✅ Deep merge completed: {
  tripName: "My Trip",
  dayCount: 3,
  firstDayRegion: "New Value",
  totalPlaces: 8
}
```
